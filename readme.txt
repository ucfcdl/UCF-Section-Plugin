Provides a custom post type, shortcode and functions for displaying Sections.


== Description ==

Adds a new post type called Sections that can be added to pages using a `[ucf-section]` shortcode. Sections will display content from within the WordPress editor.

The `[ucf-section]` shortcode has several options:
* `slug` - the slug of the section to be displayed
* `id` - the ID of the section to be displayed (as an alternative to providing the `slug` attribute)
* `class` - CSS class(es) to assign to the generated `<section>` element. By default, sections will always have the `.ucf-section-SLUG` class assigned to them.
* `title` - a descriptive title to use both as an accessible `aria-label` value for screenreaders in the generated `<section>` element, and in navbar links generated by the [Automatic Sections Menu Shortcode](https://github.com/UCF/Section-Menus-Shortcode).
* `section_id` - a value to assign as the `ID` attribute of the generated `<section>` element.
* `random_from_tag` - if provided a tag slug, a random section will be chosen to display from sections that are assigned the given tag.
